Userspace and kernel space are two fundamental concepts in operating systems, including Docker containers. Understanding the difference between these two spaces is essential for developing and deploying secure and reliable software.

**Userspace**

Userspace is the environment where user-facing applications run. This includes applications such as web servers, Chrome, text editors, and command utilities. Userspace applications are also known as userland applications.

Userspace applications cannot directly access the system’s hardware resources. They must make system calls to the kernel to request access to these resources.

**Kernel space**

Kernel space is where the core of the operating system, the kernel, operates. The kernel is responsible for managing the system’s resources, such as the CPU, memory, and storage. It also provides system calls, which are interfaces that allow userspace applications to interact with the kernel.

The kernel has unrestricted access to the system’s hardware resources. This is necessary for the kernel to perform its essential tasks, such as scheduling processes, managing memory, and handling interrupts.

**Separation of userspace and kernel space**

The separation of userspace and kernel space is a fundamental design principle in operating systems. This separation provides a number of benefits, including:

-   **Security:**  It prevents userspace applications from accidentally or maliciously corrupting the kernel or other system resources.
-   **Stability:**  It makes the operating system more stable by isolating the kernel from potential failures in userspace applications.
-   **Performance:**  It can improve the performance of the operating system by allowing the kernel to run in a protected environment.

**Example**

Let’s take a real-world example of a simple Linux  `ls`  command. When you run the  `ls`  command to list files, the following happens:

1.  The  `ls`  command is executed in userspace.
2.  The  `ls`  command makes a system call (`getdents()`) to the kernel, asking it to list the files in the current directory.
3.  The kernel receives the system call and performs the requested operation.
4.  The kernel returns the results of the operation to the  `ls`  command.
5.  The  `ls`  command displays the results to the user.

In this example, the  `ls`  command is a userspace application that needs to access the system's files. To do this, the  `ls`  command makes a system call to the kernel. The kernel then performs the requested operation and returns the results to the  `ls`  command.

**Conclusion**

The separation of userspace and kernel space is a fundamental concept in operating systems and containers. It provides a number of benefits, including security, stability, and performance.

By understanding the difference between userspace and kernel space, developers can build and deploy more secure and reliable software
